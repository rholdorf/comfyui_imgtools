## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase pipeline following detection -> crop/align -> morph -> composite dependency chain
- [Research]: Python 3.14/3.13 incompatibility with MediaPipe is primary risk -- must verify/resolve in Phase 1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research] MediaPipe only supports Python 3.9-3.12; ComfyUI may run on 3.13/3.14. Must verify in Phase 1.
