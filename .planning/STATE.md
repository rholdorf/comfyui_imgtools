# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Morph source face shape to match target face proportions so downstream face swap produces natural results
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Environment and Detection

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Environment and Detection)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-10 -- Completed 01-02 FaceDetect node

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-environment-and-detection | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2min)
- Trend: Starting

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase pipeline following detection -> crop/align -> morph -> composite dependency chain
- [Research]: Python 3.14/3.13 incompatibility with MediaPipe is primary risk -- must verify/resolve in Phase 1
- [01-01]: Added pyproject.toml with pythonpath config for pytest module resolution
- [01-01]: Landmarker caching includes parameter comparison for confidence thresholds
- [Phase 01-02]: Used try/except conditional import for graceful degradation when mediapipe missing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [RESOLVED] MediaPipe 0.10.18 works in ComfyUI conda env (Python 3.12.7). No version conflict.
